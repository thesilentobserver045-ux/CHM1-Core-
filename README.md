# 🧠 CHM‑1: Cognitive Hybrid Model

> **A civilizational approach to AI in data-scarce environments**  
> Built from Egyptian cognitive roots, designed for human-aligned reasoning.

CHM‑1 is not another agent. It’s a **hybrid cognitive architecture** that blends:
- Pattern recognition from ancient epistemic traditions,
- Ethical reasoning from human depth,
- Adaptive memory systems,
- And structured problem-solving — all within a sovereignty-first framework.

## 🔮 Vision
To offer an **alternative AI paradigm** that doesn’t mimic Western agent-centric models, but instead draws from civilizational archives (like Egypt’s 80-million-year life archive) to build context-aware, values-driven intelligence.

## ▶️ How to Use
This is a **skeleton implementation** in Python. You can:
- Study the architecture
- Adapt modules to your research
- Build upon it for civilizational AI projects

> ⚠️ Full integration with LLMs, vector DBs, and ethical engines is planned in future phases.

## 🌍 Philosophy
> "Some models announce their battles. CHM doesn’t. It observes, reasons, and acts — in silence."
